## 🛠️ To-Do List  

- [ ] Add disambiguation for piece moves (e.g. two knights/rooks able to go to the same square)  
- [ ] Add time control options: Bullet, Blitz, and Rapid  
- [ ] Implement **Multiplayer Mode** over local WiFi  

---

## 🐞 Needs Fixing  

- [ ] Highlight colors should fully respect the chosen board theme  
- [ ] AI engine is currently limited (~600 ELO), and needs improvements  
- [ ] Move history in single-player currently logs internal AI evaluations — should only display final chosen move
